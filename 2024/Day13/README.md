# Day 13

This is about solving a system of linear equations. While many solvers ecan be used from numpy or scipy, checks and internal bookkeeping procedures probably make it cheaper to simply implemnt Cramer's rule for a 2x2 system. 

If the integer solution is equal to Cramer's solution, the moves can be done. The cost can be computed with $c = 3*x + y$

Part 2 is nothing more than adding 10_000_000_000_000 to the right-hand-side?
